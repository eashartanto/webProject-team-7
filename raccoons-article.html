            <p>The furry masked bandits have been a problem in Toronto for years, but with COVID lockdowns and less human activity, raccoons seem to be everywhere.</p>

            <p>According to the City of Toronto, there has been a huge jump in raccoon encounters since COVID began. A March news release states that animal services saw a 300% jump in service requests for sick and injured animals last year over 2019; between January of 2020 and February of 2021, there was a 62% increase in reports of people being bitten or scratched by raccoons over previous yearly averages.</p>
            <p>The main takeaway: Stay away from raccoons and all other wildlife and do not feed the animals. Secure your garbage and don’t feed pets outside.</p>
            <p>Protect your pets. Besides a rabies vaccine, your dog needs to be vaccinated against Leptospirosis, Giardia, roundworm and canine distemper, all of which can be passed along by raccoon urine and feces.</p>

                <cite>We’re getting more calls than ever before. Calls for raccoons are off the charts.</cite>
            </div>
            <p>Mike Heimbach, director of business development and marketing at <a href="https://www.abellpestcontrol.com/en-CA/Locations/Toronto?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvYOK2viI8QIVWPfjBx03RQOlEAAYASAAEgJ-PfD_BwE">Abell Pest Control</a>, swears by the ounce of prevention approach.</p>
            <p>The trick with controlling wildlife around your house is to be proactive — take preventative steps before there’s a problem. Once raccoons are eating your garbage or living in your attic, it’s hard to get them to change their habits.</p>
            <p>Heimbach has seen every kind of wildlife infestation — raccoons, skunks, bats — and he feels your pain. The animals can do enormous damage to your domicile while setting up housekeeping for themselves.</p>
            <p>“We’re getting more calls than ever before,” said Heimbach in an interview Tuesday. “Calls for raccoons are off the charts.”</p>
