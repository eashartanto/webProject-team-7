					Selva is a glow-in-the-dark jungle-themed restaurant serving cocktails
					and a menu of South American eats by Chef Nuit Regular. This
					luminescent extravaganza, which takes over the basement of The Fifth
					Social Club, sits somewhere between laser tag and Rainforest Cafe.
				</p>
				<p>
					What used to be the Fifth’s unremarkable lower-level pub has been
					transformed by a deluge of floor-to-ceiling artwork by Clandestinos
					Art, comprised of husband-and-wife team Bruno Smoky and Shalak Attack.
				</p>

					After a successful summer of technicolour patio fun at RendezViews (a
					collab with neighbour The Ballroom), The Fifth’s owner Oliver Gedde
					continues the escapist M.O. with an indoor getaway that can be visited
					year-round.
				</p>
				<p>
					The result is a trippy black light-lit venue complete with 3D
					neon-eyed aye-ayes and ayahuasca apparitions of lions and tigers. It’s
					certainly photogenic, but the space falls a little flat during dinner
					service thanks to lights that need to stay on during meal time. It's
					G-rated minus the immersive frills of animal sound effects and robotic
					hippos from childhood.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apparently Selva leans into the low-lit, cocktail atmosphere after
					that. I'd suggest coming then to really enjoy the artwork if it didn't
					mean missing out on Chef Regular’s delicious dinner dishes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The chef behind PAI, Sabai Sabai and Kiin has come up with an
					extensive menu that bridges some elements of Thai cuisine with South
					American cooking. Expect lots of limes, coconut, a signature red
					pepper sauce and some keto and gluten-free options (a shoutout to her
					husband Jeff.)
				</p>
				<p>
					The ceviches ($18 each) showcase some outstanding combinations of
					ingredients. The version with strips of fresh young coconut
					incorporates red serrano chili mint and edible flowers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Alaskan sole ceviche has grilled corn and fish roe. Both use
					magrud lime, passion fruit and are served with tortilla chips.
				</p>

				<p>
					Grilled corn ($15) is served in the husk with cotija, coconut butter,
					paprika and coriander.
				</p>
				<p>
					Shishito peppers are grilled and stuffed with pork belly sausage. It’s
					served with the signature red pepper sauce, fresh turmeric, lemongrass
					and other aromatics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Grilled boneless chicken thighs ($22) are served with red pepper,
					pickled onions, fried shallots and coriander.
				</p>
				<p>
					A small portion of tomato rice ($7) is garlicky and to die for. It’s
					made with a special variety of Thai rice that’s low in sugar.
				</p>
				<p>
					For dessert, deep-fried banana fritters ($14) come with a warm coconut
					sauce. The corn gelato ($12) is a collab with Death in Venice Gelato,
					using sweet corn and butterfly pea flower.
				</p>
				<p>
					Shake yourself from the family vacay vibes with one of the cocktails
					on tap. The Don Julio Margarita ($17.50) comes with a Tajin rim.
				</p>
				<p>
					An Espresso Lion’s Mane ($14) is a mix of Ketel One vodka, Galliano
					and PowerPlant Superfoods THINK coffee, which contains Lion’s Mane
					mushrooms. A bit of that shroomy boost will hold you over until DJ
					hours.
