                    <p class = "page-subtitle">Canada’s largest city is home to one of the most multicultural populations 
                        in the world, which means there is a diverse, ever-evolving set of 
                        activities to choose from across all forms of culture. 
                        Whether you’re looking to dive into Toronto’s vast number of museums, 
                        explore nature in its parks, or sample from its varied cuisines, 
                        there is plenty to fill any itinerary. Our recommendation? Take it all in bit by bit. 
                        There’s always another chance to come back and see more.

            <h1><a>Toronto Music Garden</a></h1>
            <div class="article-wrapper">
                <p id = "article-paragraph">This urban garden located in Toronto’s Harbourfront neighborhood is very accessible to 
                    tourists walking around downtown—and it has great views of the CN Tower. 
                    As for the garden itself: Yo-Yo Ma, the cello maestro, can put “landscape architect” on 
                    his resume after having collaborated on the Toronto Music Garden with professional 
                    landscape architect Julie Moir Messervy. For the project, the duo physically interpreted 
                    and manifested Johann Sebastian Bach’s Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major, the first of the 
                    composer’s six suites for unaccompanied cello, as a garden, using the piece’s six dance movements 
                    (Prelude, Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Menuet, and Gigue) to create different sections of 
                    the green space. At the center is the Gigue (or Jig) section, a grassy amphitheater with a 
                    stage beneath a weeping willow tree where free classical music concerts are held each summer.</p>

            <h1><a >Art Gallery of Ontario</a></h1>
            <div class="article-wrapper">
                <p id = "article-paragraph">Both the permanent and temporary exhibits are well-thought out and well-presented, 
                    and the topics of world-class special shows are as varied and detailed as the regular collection</p>
                <!-- <img class = "sub-image left" src="assets/images/upcoming-music.jpg" width="600px" height="600px"/> -->
                <p class="article-title">Zoom out. What’s this place all about?</p>
                <p id = "article-paragraph">From the works of European masters, Central African artists, and 
                    emerging Indigenous Canadians to cutting-edge contemporary pieces that challenge and inspire, 
                    you’ll find it all in this museum’s nearly-100,000-piece-strong collection. In addition to being 
                    one of the largest art museums in North America, it’s also one of Canada’s most photographed
                     architectural sites—thanks to the soaring 2008 expansion designed by Frank Gehry.</p>              
                <p class="article-title">Ye shall know them by their permanent collection: How was it?</p>
                <p id = "article-paragraph">There's a lot here to marvel at (and process), 
                    so plan to settle in for a chunk of time—or come back again. Or zero in 
                    on your passions. Into photography? Revel in a collection that includes 
                    pieces by Garry Winogrand and Diane Arbus. Fine art fans will be transported 
                    by the landscapes of the legendary Group of Seven Canadian painters, the rich 
                    tones of Rubens’ The Massacre of The Innocents, and the details of the Gothic 
                    miniatures. And thanks to special exhibits that highlight emerging and 
                    underrepresented artists, there’s always something new to discover.</p>
                <p class="article-title">But also by their new shoes. How were the exhibits?</p>
                <p id = "article-paragraph">Both the permanent and temporary exhibits are 
                    well-thought-out and well-presented, and the topics of world-class 
                    special shows are as varied and detailed as the regular collection. 
                    For example, past visiting shows have spotlighted the Ojibwe community 
                    and language, the “monsters” in the works of filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, 
                    and Yayoi Kusama’s crowd-pleasing Infinity Mirrors light installation.</p>
